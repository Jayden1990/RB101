# What is the return value of the select method below? Why?

[1, 2, 3].select do |num|
  num > 5
  'hi'
end

# select performs selection based on the truthiness of the block's return value. 
# In this case the return value will always be 'hi', which is a "truthy" value. 
# Therefore select will return a new array containing all of the elements in the original array.
